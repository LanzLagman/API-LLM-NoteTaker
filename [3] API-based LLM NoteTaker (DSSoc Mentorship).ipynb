    "- Data had become the most valuable resource in the world and was being used to generate insights and innovations that impacted industries and communities: At the time of the event, data had already transformed the way organizations operate and make decisions. The insights generated from data had the potential to revolutionize industries and improve the lives of people. With the massive amounts of data being generated every day, it had become crucial to understand the importance of data ethics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The proper use of data was emphasized then more than ever: As data grew in importance and power, there was a growing concern over its misuse. Ethical considerations had become increasingly important in data science and analytics. It was important to use data in a way that was responsible, transparent, and respects privacy and human rights.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sir Benedict Olgado, a PhD student at the University of California, Irvine, talked about the ethical use of data: Sir Olgado's expertise and knowledge in the field of data ethics made the talk a valuable opportunity for individuals and organizations to learn more about the ethical considerations that should be taken when handling data. It was important to hear from experts who can provide valuable insights into the responsible use of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The talk was held in partnership with Diliman Learning Resource Center and was livestreamed on Facebook on Oct 6, 10-11 AM: The partnership between UP Data Science Society and Diliman Learning Resource Center provided a platform for individuals and organizations to learn more about data ethics. The livestreaming of the event on Facebook made it accessible to a wider audience, making it possible for more people to learn about the responsible use of data."
