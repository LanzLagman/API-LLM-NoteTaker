- Study on Empowering Citizens to Build Better Bike Lanes through Open Contracting presented.
- Study covers 12 publicly available pop-up bike lane contracts worth around a billion pesos that financed the construction of 497 kilometers of bike lanes in Metro Manila, Metro Cebu, and Metro Davao.
- Major findings: cost of bike lanes, government savings through bidders, procurement timeline, data completeness and quality, bidding and competition, and trust in open contracting.
- Policy recommendations: enhance transparency, participation, and accountability measures, build a procurement integrity movement, and co-create a stronger and more inclusive open contracting commitment for the next Open Government Partnership National Action Plan.
- Presentation not to conclude fraud or corruption, but to shape future procurement cycles to be more responsive to community needs.
