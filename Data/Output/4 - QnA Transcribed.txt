In the remaining 15 minutes of our time, bubuksan po natin ang panel for our question and answers portion. So meron natin mga maagang nag-send ng question, itatanong po natin sa inyo. Unahin po natin ang isa sa kahit sa researchers natin. So ano po yung proseso ng pag-locate ng procurement contracts and extracting the relevant data points? So research team ba ito? Maybe si Rina and Lance can help answer. Hello, actually thanks to the DPWH website, we were able to, it was actually the one task with procuring the documents so I created a python script for web scraping the DPWH website. I was given a list of links so from that I built a python script for accessing these URLs then downloading the available documents for our analysis. Dito ba si Ma'am Rina? Maybe she can add? That's the summary. Thank you. Yes, thank you Lance. Yes, to give some picture, actually the URLs are also included in our open dataset. So you can actually go to the DPWH portal and then meron siyang interface na merong form then you can input yung keyword or contact number and then magre-return siya ng matches. And as we mentioned, we tried bike lanes and then we got one contract and then we downloaded the documents for that. And then based on the contract number, dun naman lumabas yung mga ibang contracts and then we looked for numbers na magkasunod hanggang hindi na bike lane contract yung lumabas. So that's the process when we collected initially the documents. Baka may nakarase ng hand din si Asick. Si Asick Erick. Asick Erick, before you answer may dagdag question ako para po dalawang tuhog kayo. Yung question ko for DPWH, sabay ko na po. Saan po makakatulong ang DPWH sa pag-facilitate ng book and approach para po mas na-involve ang civil society in different road projects? Saan po kaming espasyon pwede pumasok para po makatulong kami sa planning and monitoring? Thank you for the question. Unahin ko lang muna yung difficulty to get data sa ating website. Actually yun ang talagang tama naman kasi unless gawitin mo talaga yung number niya, contract ID number, yun talaga lang ang mag-cocue para ma-access mo lahat yung data. Pero we are planning to collaborate dun sa aming information management system sa kasi yung nagmanage dahat ng mga information sa website ng DPWH So that's how we can improve para at least kung mayroong palang queue na bicycle na lalabas lahat yung mga contract na hinahanap natin. Rest assured na makikipag-collaborate kami dun sa aming INS which is the one controlling that portion of our website. Dun sa binanggit mo na book and how the CSOs can... yung binanggit ko kanina sa procurement natin actually allowed naman base sa ating RN9184. Except for the COA, we are allowed two observers. So we are looking, binanggit ko kanina, we are looking to the possibility na makatulong kami sa accreditation kung sino siguro gusto ng cycling group na maging observer natin sa bidding. Sa procurement stage natin pwede tayo makatulong siguro sa facilitation o accreditation. Ngayon pagating naman dun sa improvement natin sa mga design, namanggit ko naman kanina, anytime naman pwede mag-propose yung ating mga academe para ma-improve pa natin yung ating DO263 ata yun. Yeah, DO263. Kasi as you very well know, last isang beses pa lang tayo nag-implement ng bike lane. Actually yung LG yung nauno pa sa atin yan. Yung kaninang ipinlas na Agham Road, actually kesong city na may gawa noon, hindi namin design yung in-adopt nila dun. So as we progress with the following years na nag-implement, we are hoping na ma-improve pa natin talaga based on the suggestion of the CSOs and other stakeholders po natin. Salamat po Asic Eric. We have 9 minutes left so I have 3 questions remaining. Yung first po ako magtatanong and then yung third question, meron daw pong special question si Ate Zai for this conversation. So ito po, kayak po muna si Tina and then after po noon Kuya Patsan and Asic Eric, sa inyo po ulit yung next 2 questions. So Madam Tina, ano yung improvements na gusto mong makita sa current bike lanes so that people would use them? And how would you use this data as well to convince public and private officials on the importance of bike lanes? Great question. It's also something I've been learning along the way and it really comes from experience. So ngayon po, nakikita natin na in the early stages of putting up bike lanes, nagsisimula siya sa mga efforts such as pagpipintura, paglalagay ng signages, may bike lane dito, paglalagay din ng mga ilaw. Pero nakita natin na yung pinakamahalaga para sa mga siklista talaga and even regular active transport users, yung may protection and it comes in different forms. It comes in the forms of bollards, some put nut boxes, yung iba cemento. At nakikita talaga natin yung pagiba sa experience ng mga commuter. Mas nai-empower hindi lang yung mga lalaki na magbike pero pati yung kababaihan. And a lot of us, everyday cyclists and commuters are documenting these experiences. Marami kasi sa amin for the sake of our safety. Merong mga dash cam na nilalagay either sa chest or sa mga helmets nila. Yung iba naman lagi nilang dinodocument if they come into conflict with other road users. Meron ng practice of getting plate numbers, location, what exactly was the incident so we know how to report. And another thing is keeping track of course of our routes. So it's not just the quality of experience but the actual trips, what is happening to us, where do we need to go. And these kinds of data, we just post usually on our different social media sites but we really want to find ways and opportunities to harness this kind of information. Kasi nakita po natin from our experience working with local governments, private sector, na mahanagang na pagsasama yung ganitong klaseng impormasyon. Kasi with people-led, people-sourced, crowd-sourced information, nakakaroon tayo ng better concrete idea kung paano mapapalitan yung configuration ng mga kalsada natin. Even in simple ways na hindi kailangan may napakalaking infrastructure change agad. So we learned from our experience that configurations coming from concepts of tactical urbanism, putting up bollards in some spaces to reduce conflict zones, putting up proper signages and even simple infrastructure that you can just put on the streets will really do a lot. And I hope that our representatives here today in our government can find opportunities to harness that information and use our everyday experiences to make simple but impactful interventions. Thank you. Salamat Madam Tina. Kuya Patson may tanong ako sa iyo tapos tag ko si ate Vivian kasi may tanong siya directed to Asek Erick. So sa iyo kuya Patson kasi nag-quantum ang bili si Asek Erick kanina on opportunities na pwede gangitin at psyche groups and active transport users sa DPWH para mas ma-involve sila sa procurement process. Sa DOTR po ba, ano po yung mga espasyo at oportunidad na pwede pasukan? Thank you, Haya. So since part naman ng DOTR, kaya ngayon mainly concerned kami with planning ng ating infrastructure, yung network ng bike lane. And kami din involved din kami with the monitoring ng ating mga infrastructure. So bukas yung office, yung tanggapan to receive any comments, any inputs, or any suggestions. And kami din mismo yung team, directly yung Active Transport Office. Kami mismo nakaantabay din kami. We always notice and we always take into consideration lahat ng mga nabanggit ni Tina na lahat ng mga nakikita namin on social media, these are all taken into consideration. So even without anyone or any group or any entity approaching us for suggestions, for comments, kami mismo we already proactively try to do something about it within our bounds and within our jurisdiction. But definitely, aside from that, kami mismo din, we take notice and we take action as much as we can. Yung procurement namin, if ever we would be having procurement soon with our infrastructure, definitely the CSOs will be invited. Kami din mismo in our internal guidelines, we are really required to do so. So rest assured that you will be able to receive invites. And I think even during the budget process, certain CSOs were also invited by our planning office. So yeah, yun po yung magiging space that the community and the civil society can take advantage of. Pwede magdagdag? Gusto ko lang po kailangan ko sabihin na super na appreciate po namin yung DOTR active transport team, especially since pasok na pasok na talaga yung CSO collaboration sa budget cycle. And I'd even go as far as saying leader na yung DOTR in budget transparency and participation. And I think logical continuation yung procurement transparency and participation doon sa pagpapalawak ng espasyo. So maraming salamat sa DOTR colleagues and also sa DPWH colleagues for including CSOs doon po sa processes, sa policymaking processes natin. And the active transport team actually also sends updates na binuksan po ng DOTR yung current by clean contracts para makita rin ng CSOs para sa 2022 budget yung status ng procurement na yun. So nagpapasalamat po kami sa DOTR kinakinapat sa iyo. Thank you! Thank you, thank you Ken. Si Ate Vivian has a question and then si Ate Zy. Okay, very short lang kasi I remember a couple of years back nag-issue si DBM ng budget memorandum, National Budget Memorandum 109, which basically allows for CSO participation in the planning and budgeting process. So I was wondering lang, Asec, Eric, if this is still being done by DPWH because I was thinking that it could still be a very good entry point for CSOs to continue participating and shaping policies and for instance including bike lanes as part of priority budget considerations of the department. Thank you! Yes ma'am. Actually we are scheduling that sometime in March every year. For example for the funding for the proposal for the next year 2024, bago kami mag-submit ng budget after the RDC, the Regional Development Council project proposals, nagseset talaga kami ng schedule sa mga CSOs. And in fact, nakafirma sila talaga doon sa mga budget proposal. May follow up ko po ba Ate Vivian? Sige po. Ako pala may comment. Actually great to hear po yung sa DPWH. I think nasusunod naman talaga yung process in terms of budget consultations. I think part din po ba ng requirement ng makareceive ng invite ay dapat accredited kahit sa budget processor or pwede pong mag-submit lang kami ng emails ng mga CSO reps na baka pwedeng mapadala din ng invitation po ng DPWH? Based on our experience, dapat accredited e kasi pipirma sila. Dapat may accreditation? Yes. So this is talaga yung next step para sa pagpapalawak ng spaces for the DPWH processes. Alright, thank you sir. Thank you pa Ate Eric. Last po natin for 2 minutes overtime si Ate Zai and then we can conclude the forum po. Good afternoon po everyone and congrats to Misol Foundation for coming up with this study. I also wanted to comment po DPWH and DOTR for the very positive feedback. Since we're talking rin naman po about participation in planning, I was just wondering if either DPWH or DOTR or the 2 agencies together have plans to come up with something like a national cycling network. Maybe something similar to the National Road Network Plan kasi in my mind this would set the stage for budget predictability in terms of active transport para sa bike lanes. It will also make budgeting for active transport more programmatic as well as programmatic din na pag-participate ng civil society sa procurement planning. I asked this question since Ken already mentioned that the logical next step for budget participation which the DOTR has also been really open to civil society about can be a bit more structured and systematized. Kasi since of course in government parlance, nandun po palagi dapat yung planning and budgeting linkage and susunod natin yung procurement. I'm just wondering if there are plans to come up with such a strategic plan and maybe make it into a convergence project with DOT as well para maging some sort of tourism project. Isa sagad ko na rin po, I have another question. I'm also wondering if the MVUC, Special Road Safety Fund has already been tapped as well for active transport. Since we know it's very car-centric, the purpose of the road safety initiatives that are typically funded by the Special Road Safety Fund is more for the safety of car users. So just wondering din po if there have already been instances where that particular fund was tapped for bike lanes and active transport. Yun lang po, thank you very much. On the part of DPWH po, sabi ko nga we support fully. Pero in this case siguro si DOTR dapat mag-lead kasi po sila sa kanilang nanggaling yung pondo. With regards po dun sa MVUC naman, basically kasi yung MVUC fund comes from the registration ng ating mga sasakyan. But in the last budget, nabasa namin doon sa special provisions nya that all national roads, meaning the DPWH mandated roads, are encouraged to always include in their program, if feasible, yung bike lanes po natin. Thank you sir. Thank you po. Welcome. On the part of DOTR, tama po sila si Erick. The DOTR is the one mandated under our joint administrative order between the DOH, DOTR, DILG, and DPWH, creating the Interagency Technical Working Group for Active Transport. So the DOTR is mainly mandated to do the planning of the active transport infrastructure. We are happy to announce naman that the funds for this year 2023 General Appropriations Act, we have allocated funds from there for the phase 1 of 2 ng ating Active Transport Strategic Master Plan. So the approach that we intend is nationwide. So basically lahat ng roads and lahat ng local government units will be included. But syempre, in terms of planning, we have to prioritize some areas. Ang tinitingnan namin ngayon is the major urban areas. Since yun, we see active transport as a traffic congestion solution, as we know. And that's why we intend to focus on those areas that are already congested. So sila yung kailangan natin unang agapan. And aside from that, we also have taken into consideration cycling tourism. So one of the projects that we have right now under the 2022 GAA is the expansion of active and public transport infrastructure in Intramuros. So our closest historical site natin dito sa Metro, at least for Metro Manila, which is Intramuros, we have already allocated funds. And actually, tomorrow yung ating groundbreaking ceremony for the projects in Intramuros. So this is also in partnership with the Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority. So I believe we have sent some invites to some civil society already for the groundbreaking tomorrow. So yeah, cycling tourism definitely that's taken into consideration. It's part of the economy as well. Dahil we have some cases that we have observed, especially I think one of the best cycling tourism areas is in Taiwan. Sila talaga yung nag-invest heavily in cycling paths for tourism purposes. And talagang di na dayo sila doon. So yeah, we will be also having, aside from yung Phase 1, nung Strategic Master Plan, so yung Phase 2 naman, pinilit lang namin sila given that the Philippines is a big country. So yeah, yung Phase 1 will focus on the urban areas and the Phase 2 probably the rest of the areas. So yeah, these are currently in the development of the terms of reference actually. And we are in coordination with the planning team ng DOTR. Salamat po, salamat kuya Patsan. Tama po yun, sorry, natawa ko na Philippines is a big country. Tama, sobrang laking bansa po talaga natin. At magandang idea po yung suggestion na gawin din siya in coordination with tourism. Kasi hindi lang po talaga congestion solution at mobility solution ang active transport but also a lot of tourists. Ang hira po ma-access ng tourist sites natin eh kung hindi ka nakakoche. Kasi po karamihan ang tourist destinations, hindi naman po accessible by commuting. So marami pong salamat.
